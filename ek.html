        EK Water Blocks Releases EK-Vector Series Water Blocks for AMD Radeon
        VII

    <p>
      EK Water Blocks, the leading premium computer liquid cooling gear
      manufacturer, is releasing EK-Vector Radeon VII water blocks that are
      compatible with reference design AMD Radeon VII graphics cards. This kind
      of efficient cooling will allow your high-end graphics card to reach
      higher boost clocks, thus providing more overclocking headroom and more
      performance during gaming or other GPU intense tasks.<br />
      <br />

      This water block directly cools the GPU, 16GB of HBM2 memory, and VRM
      (voltage regulation module) as cooling liquid is channeled directly over
      these critical areas. These newly developed water blocks feature a
      redesigned cooling engine that has a larger footprint compared to the
      previous generation of EK Full Cover water blocks. This results in a
      larger surface area for heat transfer which increases the thermal
      performance of these water blocks.

    <p>
      The base of the block is made of high-grade copper or nickel-plated
      electrolytic copper while the top is made of high-quality acrylic material
      or POM Acetal material (depending on the variant). The front aesthetic
      corner piece is lit up with LED strip (in RGB variants). The top material
      does not affect the block performance in any way. The block also features
      a special plastic cover over the block Terminal. This add-on is designed
      to reveal the graphics card model, visible from the side. Sealing is
      ensured by high-quality EPDM O-Rings. The brass standoffs are already
      pre-installed and allow for a safe and easy installation procedure.<br />
      <br />

      The EK-Vector Radeon VII water blocks are compatible with popular RGB sync
      technologies from all major motherboard manufacturers since it features a
      classic 4-pin 12V RGB LED strip.
      <br /><br />

      The EK-Vector Radeon VII water blocks are compatible with the reference
      design Radeon VII graphics cards.
      <br /><br />

      Liquid cooling your Radeon VII GPU will allow you to overclock it to the
      maximum clock allowed by the card and reach 10-20% better results
      depending on workload or game you're playing. Even while overclocked your
      card will reach far lower temperatures and less noise than factory clocked
      with air cooling ensuring an even longer lifespan of the card.
      <br /><br />

      <strong>Availability and pricing</strong><br />

      Europe and are available for pre-order through the EK Webshop or EK
      Partner Reseller Network. EK-Vector Radeon VII water blocks and backplates
