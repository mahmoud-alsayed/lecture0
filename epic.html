      Not all news coming from EPIC covers its EPIC Games Store - though
      according to the relative attention they've been garnering with the
      constant scooping up of PC timed exclusives, perhaps it should. This piece
      of news, alas, covers the company's unreal Engine, which has been one of
      the hallmarks in games development for a while now, being used for a
      number of disparate games such as the gears of War games, or even a
      relatively obscure, Xbox 360 exclusive title, Lost Odyssey. At GDC 2019,
      EPIC showcased version 4.23 of its Unreal Engine, with particular
      attention to its improved destruction and physics engine, which they've
      aptly named "Chaos".

      The demo EPIC games used to showcase their new Chaos physics and
      destruction engine is set in the world of Robo Recall, their FPS VR title,
      and for good effect. The focus here is on high-quality, cinematic visuals
      with little work being leftover for coders, as artists can simply render
      their chosen architectures and expect them to behave with correct physical
      qualities upon destruction. It is eerily reminiscent of Microsoft's
      Crackdown 3 physics reveal, though, which supposedly used the power of the
      cloud - a facet of the game that was toned down considerably for its
      eventual release.
