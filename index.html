              EK Water Blocks Releases EK-Vector Series Water Blocks for AMD
              Radeon VII
            </a></ins

        <p>
          EK Water Blocks, the leading premium computer liquid cooling gear
          manufacturer, is releasing EK-Vector Radeon VII water blocks that are
          compatible with reference design AMD Radeon VII graphics cards. This
          kind of efficient cooling will allow your high-end graphics card to
          reach higher boost clocks, thus providing more overclocking headroom
          and more performance during gaming or other GPU intense tasks.<br />
          <br />

          This water block directly cools the GPU, 16GB of HBM2 memory, and VRM
          (voltage regulation module) as cooling liquid is channeled directly
          over these critical areas. These newly developed water blocks feature
          a redesigned cooling engine that has a larger footprint compared to
          the previous generation of EK Full Cover water blocks. This results in
          a larger surface area for heat transfer which increases the thermal
          performance of these water blocks.

        <p>
          Not all news coming from EPIC covers its EPIC Games Store - though
          according to the relative attention they've been garnering with the
          constant scooping up of PC timed exclusives, perhaps it should. This
          piece of news, alas, covers the company's unreal Engine, which has
          been one of the hallmarks in games development for a while now, being
          used for a number of disparate games such as the gears of War games,
          or even a relatively obscure, Xbox 360 exclusive title, Lost Odyssey.
          At GDC 2019, EPIC showcased version 4.23 of its Unreal Engine, with
          particular attention to its improved destruction and physics engine,
          which they've aptly named "Chaos".

              Several Gen11 GPU Variants Referenced in Latest Intel Drivers
            </a>
          </ins>

        <p>
          The latest version of Intel Graphics drivers which introduce the
          company's latest UWP-based Graphics Command Center app, hide another
          secret in their INF. The file has pointers to dozens of variants and
          implementations of the company's next-generation Gen11 integrated
          graphics architecture, which we detailed in a recent article. Intel
          will implement Gen11 on two key processor microarchitectures, "Ice
          Lake" and "Lakefield," although later down the line, the graphics
          technology could trickle down to low-power Pentium Silver and Celeron
          SoC lines, too, with chips based on the "Elkhart Lake" silicon.<br /><br />

          There are 13 variants of Gen11 on "Ice Lake," carved using execution
          unit (EU) count, and LP (low-power) aggressive power management. The
          mainstream desktop processors based on "Ice Lake," which are least
          restrained in power-management, get the most powerful variants of
          Gen11 under the Iris Plus brand. Iris Plus Graphics 950 is the most
          powerful implementation, with all 64 EUs enabled, and the highest GPU
          clock speeds. This variant could feature on Core i7 and Core i9 brands
          derived from "Ice Lake." Next up, is the Iris Plus Graphics 940, with
          the same EU count, but likely lower clock speeds, which could feature
          across the vast lineup of Core i5 SKUs. The Iris Plus 930 comes in two
          trims based on EU count, of 64 and 48, and could likely be spread
          across the Core i3 lineup. Lastly, there's the Iris Plus 920 with 32
          EUs, which could be found in Pentium Gold SKUs. There are various SKUs
          branded "UHD Graphics Gen11 LP," with EU counts ranging from 32 to 64.

              AMD Ryzen 3000 "Zen 2" BIOS Analysis Reveals New Options for

        <p>
          AMD will launch its 3rd generation Ryzen 3000 Socket AM4 desktop
          processors in 2019, with a product unveiling expected mid-year, likely
          on the sidelines of Computex 2019. AMD is keeping its promise of
          making these chips backwards compatible with existing Socket AM4
          motherboards. To that effect, motherboard vendors such as ASUS and MSI
          began rolling out BIOS updates with AGESA-Combo 0.0.7.x microcode,
          which adds initial support for the platform to run and validate
          engineering samples of the upcoming "Zen 2" chips.<br />

          At CES 2019, AMD unveiled more technical details and a prototype of a
          3rd generation Ryzen socket AM4 processor. The company confirmed that
          it will implement a multi-chip module (MCM) design even for their
          mainstream-desktop processor, in which it will use one or two 7 nm
          "Zen 2" CPU core chiplets, which talk to a 14 nm I/O controller die
          over Infinity Fabric. The two biggest components of the IO die are the
          PCI-Express root complex, and the all-important dual-channel DDR4
          memory controller. We bring you never before reported details of this
          memory controller.
