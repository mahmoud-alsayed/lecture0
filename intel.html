          Several Gen11 GPU Variants Referenced in Latest Intel Drivers

        The latest version of Intel Graphics drivers which introduce the
        company's latest UWP-based Graphics Command Center app, hide another
        secret in their INF. The file has pointers to dozens of variants and
        implementations of the company's next-generation Gen11 integrated
        graphics architecture, which we detailed in a recent article. Intel will
        implement Gen11 on two key processor microarchitectures, "Ice Lake" and
        "Lakefield," although later down the line, the graphics technology could
        trickle down to low-power Pentium Silver and Celeron SoC lines, too,
        with chips based on the "Elkhart Lake" silicon.<br /><br />

        There are 13 variants of Gen11 on "Ice Lake," carved using execution
        unit (EU) count, and LP (low-power) aggressive power management. The
        mainstream desktop processors based on "Ice Lake," which are least
        restrained in power-management, get the most powerful variants of Gen11
        under the Iris Plus brand. Iris Plus Graphics 950 is the most powerful
        implementation, with all 64 EUs enabled, and the highest GPU clock
        speeds. This variant could feature on Core i7 and Core i9 brands derived
        from "Ice Lake." Next up, is the Iris Plus Graphics 940, with the same
        EU count, but likely lower clock speeds, which could feature across the
        vast lineup of Core i5 SKUs. The Iris Plus 930 comes in two trims based
        on EU count, of 64 and 48, and could likely be spread across the Core i3
        lineup. Lastly, there's the Iris Plus 920 with 32 EUs, which could be
        found in Pentium Gold SKUs. There are various SKUs branded "UHD Graphics
        Gen11 LP," with EU counts ranging from 32 to 64.

      <p>
        Intel's "Lakefield" heterogeneous SoC comes with four models of Gen11
        graphics, based on two key variants of Gen11, GT1 and GT2, which are
        physically different in size. The GT1 variant of this iGPU is smaller
        than GT2, and likely has 32 EUs going by past trends of GT1
        configurations. All four models are labelled "UHD Graphics LKF," with no
        further model numbering. Future releases of Intel drivers could
        reference "Elkhart Lake," the upcoming low-power SoC that incorporates
        Gen11 graphics architecture.
